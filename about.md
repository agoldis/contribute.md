We, software engineers, developers and enthusiasts are always eager to learn and to improve our skills. There's a great opportunity to use the time we invest into learning, by helping the community and giving back - we can learn by contributing to open source!

By doing that we benefit from:
 - Learning from the best minds - the collective overmind
 - Have a proven record and a showcase of skills and achievements - your future employer will like it!
 - Engage and collaborate - discover new tools and befriend other geeks
 - There're plenty reasons people collaborate to build open source....

> Open source software is made by people just like you! - someone smart

Contribute.md is an early-stage project that aims to deliver the open-source scene to newcomers and experienced professionals.

We want to create a platform that will help people to effectively start learning new technologies by contributing AND to bring more collaborators and participants to OSS.

The project is still in active development, if you like the idea, tell your friends and sign up for early access.

Meanwhile, you can read more about open source at [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide)
